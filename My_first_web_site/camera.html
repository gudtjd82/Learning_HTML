        <h2>FOV</h2>
            <h4><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/field-of-view-FOV" target="_blank" title="The Source of the content">What is FOV</a></h4>
            <p>Field of view (FOV) is the open, observable area a person can see through their eyes or via an optical device, such as a camera. 
            In the case of optical devices, FOV is the maximum area that the device can capture. 
            In other words, it answers the question: "How much can the device see?"</p>

        <h2>Aperture</h2>
            <h4><a href="https://photographylife.com/what-is-aperture-in-photography" target="_blank" title="The Source of the content"> What is Aperture</a></h4>
            <p>Aperture can be defined as the opening in a lens through which light passes to enter the camera. It is an easy concept to understand if you just think about how your eyes work. As you move between bright and dark environments, the iris in your eyes either expands or shrinks, controlling the size of your pupil.</p>
            <p>In photography, the “pupil” of your lens is called aperture. You can shrink or enlarge the size of the aperture to allow more or less light to reach your camera sensor. The image below shows an aperture in a lens:

        <h2>Shutter Speed</h2>
            <h4><a href="https://photographylife.com/what-is-shutter-speed-in-photography" target="_blank" title="The Source of the content">What is Suutter Speed</a></h4>
            <p>Shutter speed is the length of time the camera shutter is open, exposing light onto the camera sensor. Essentially, it’s how long your camera spends taking a photo. This has a few important effects on how your images will appear.</p>

        <h2>ISO</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://photographylife.com/what-is-iso-in-photography" target="_blank" title="The Source of the content">What is ISO</a></h3>
            <p>The acronym ISO stands for “International Organization for Standardization”. However, camera ISO does not directly refer to the organization that creates various technology and product standards. Ever since two film standards called ASA and DIN were combined into ISO standards in 1974 (later revised for both film and digital photography), they were referred to as one word “ISO” from that point on. Although ISO initially defined only film sensitivity, it was later adopted by digital camera manufacturers with the purpose of maintaining similar brightness levels as film.</p>
